# iluz-udacity-p3-superduo

This is the repository for the Udacity Superduo (Project 3) built by Ivam Luz. It contains the source code for the following projects:

  - Alexandria
  - Football_Scores

For Alexandria, there isn't anything specific you should do in order to have the project up and running.

For Football_Scores, in order to compile and run the project propertly, you need to create a res/values/api_key.xml with the following contents:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key" translatable="false">YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
```
You can get a free API key at http://api.football-data.org/register.
